  * Scenario

    You have been supplied with two vectors of data: monthly revenue and monthly expenses for the financial year in question. Calculate the following financial metrics:
      - Profit for each month
      - Profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
      - Profit margin for each month - equals to profit after tax divided by revenue
      - Good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
      - Bad months - where the profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
      - The best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
      - The worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year

    All results need to be presented as vectors.

    Results for dollar values need to be calculated with $0.01 precision, but need to be presented in Units of $1000 (i.e. 1k) with no decimal points.

    Note: It is okay for tax for any given month to be negative (in accounting terms, negative tax translates into a deferred tax asset).

  * Scenario

    Below are two more additional in-game statistics:
    * Free Throws
    * Free Throw Attempts

    Create three plots that portray the following insights:
    * Free Throw Attempts per game
    * Accuracy of Free Throws
    * Player playing style (2 vs 3 points preference) excluding Free Throws. Each Free Throw is worth 1 points

    The data has been supplied in the form of vectors. Create the two matrices before you proceed with the analysis.

    The scatterplot needs to be categorized by Countries' Regions.
* Exercise
  * Scenario
    Produce a scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy (y-axis) and Fertility Rate (x-axis) statistics by Country.
    The scatterplot needs to also be categorized by Countriesâ€™ Regions.

    You have been supplied with data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and you are required to produce a visualization for each of these years.

    Some data has been provided in a CSV file, some - in R vectors. The CSV file contains combined data for both years. All data manipulations have to be performed in R (not in excel) because this project may be audited at a later stage.

    Provide insights into how the two periods compare.
